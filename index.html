    <h2>Types of Pollution on Diwali</h2>
</center>
<h3>Air pollution is certainly the biggest type of pollution on Diwali. Moreover, during the festival of Diwali, air pollution rises to dangerously high levels.<br>
   Most noteworthy, there is the emission of a great amount of smoke on Diwali.<br>
    This certainly makes the air very harmful to breathe. Also, this harmful effect of burning crackers remains for many days after Diwali. Furthermore, air pollution is also quite harmful to various animals and birds.

Land pollution is another significant type of pollution during Diwali. This certainly results from the leftover pieces of the burnt crackers.<br> Furthermore, it can take many weeks to clean these. Most noteworthy, these pieces are non-biodegradable in nature. Hence, they cannot be disposed of so easily. Also, they turn toxic gradually with time.

Noise pollution is a major problem during Diwali. Firecrackers cause a tremendous amount of noise pollution.<br> Most noteworthy, this noise pollution is pretty damaging to hearing. Also, noise pollution is a major problem for animals, old people, students, and sick people.</h3>
